# Kolibri Ledger
## Description
This repo holds the source code to the Kolibri Ledger. This is a distributed Ledger system build on blockchain technology.

## Status
This is a work in progress and a hobby project. I will slowly build it up using modular pieces needed. At the moment only the basics of the keypair library which uses libsodium is done.

## Tests
For all modules unit tests are available. Simple run the runtests.sh script to execute them. Every module has its own testsuite in its own folder.

## Dependencies
* libsodium
